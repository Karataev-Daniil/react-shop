# React Shop

🛒 **React Shop** is a frontend e-commerce application built with **React and TypeScript**.  
The app is structured as a modern Single-Page Application (SPA) with a component-based architecture, focusing on type safety, scalability, and clean UI.

## 🚀 Features

✔️ Product catalog with categories and filters  
✔️ Add and remove products from the cart  
✔️ Interactive cart with item count and total price  
✔️ Product pagination and “load more” modes  
✔️ Reusable and modular components  
✔️ Client-side routing with React Router  
✔️ Strong static typing with TypeScript  

## 🧠 Technologies Used

✔️ **React** — UI library ([GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react))  
✔️ **TypeScript** — static typing and safer code  
✔️ **React Router** — client-side routing  
✔️ **CSS Modules** — component-scoped styling  
✔️ Modern React hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useOutletContext`)  
✔️ Project structure inspired by Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)
